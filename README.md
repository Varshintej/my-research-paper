## 📌 Abstract
Phishing attacks remain a significant cybersecurity threat. This paper introduces a **hybrid CNN-LSTM model** that integrates CNN’s feature extraction with LSTM’s sequential learning capabilities to enhance phishing URL detection. Using a Kaggle dataset with 500,000 labeled URLs, the model is evaluated against standalone CNN and LSTM models. Results demonstrate superior accuracy and reliability in distinguishing between phishing and legitimate URLs.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- **Uses Deep Learning** for phishing detection.
- **Combines CNN and LSTM** for feature extraction and sequence learning.
- **Evaluated on a large dataset** (500,000 labeled URLs).
- **Outperforms traditional detection methods** such as blacklists and heuristic-based models.
